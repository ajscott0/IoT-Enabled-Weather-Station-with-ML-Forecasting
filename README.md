# IoT-Enabled-Weather-Station-with-ML-Forecasting

This project is comprised of two separate but cooperating parts: the weather station itself, as well as its accompanying software, and the machine learning algorithms that allow for short-term forecasting. 

The components of the weather station are: 
  1. A sealed plastic box that houses the Arduino Nano 33 Iot, all of the wiring necessary for proper data collection by the Arduino program, and two of the seven sensors -         the BH1750 light sensor and the GUVA-S12SD UV sensor.
  2. A wind-rain assembly that was purchased off the shelf and is intended to be used as a replacement part for a consumer weather station. This assembly includes an                 anenometer, a wind vain, and a tipping bucket type rain guage.
  3. A soil temperature probe which is connected to the Arduino Nano through a cable gland in the plastic box.
  4. A Stevenson screen that protects the BME280 from precipitation and direct sunlight, allowing it to accurately measures temperature, pressure, and humidity.
